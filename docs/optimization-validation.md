# Optimization validation ledger

This living ledger records the optimization measurements available on 2026-10-04.
Completed component results do **not** establish a whole-pipeline improvement.
Full scientific equivalence, total pipeline CPU, and high-memory-stage RSS
comparisons remain pending.

## Measurement and acceptance

The primary performance measure is actual **user + system CPU time**, summed over
the same executed workload and including children that their parents wait for.
Report wall time and allocated CPU-hours separately: allocated CPU-hours measure
reserved CPUs multiplied by allocation duration, not CPU actually consumed.
Measure tasks on compute nodes; timing a Nextflow driver does not include its
remote jobs. Keep inputs, configuration, thread counts, container and resource
settings comparable, record source revisions, and alternate paired run order.

GNU time and the Python child-accounting fallback report a process/descendant
maximum RSS, not the simultaneous sum of a process tree. This matters for shell
pipelines with concurrent children: that value can understate their combined
memory requirement. Preserve Slurm allocation and step records separately without
double-counting them. Distinguish intrinsic successful-workload performance from
total expenditure including retries, failed experiments, and validation itself.

Acceptance considers lower total actual CPU and lower memory in high-memory
steps. Individual stages may slow down when the full workload improves; there is
no per-step 5% threshold. Maintainability matters alongside measured gains.

Scientific data, schemas, records, formats, filenames, and within-group order must
be preserved. Existing nondeterminism in combined cross-chromgroup row order may
be normalized explicitly. Run metadata and compressed encoding may differ.
Internal floating-point differences at relative error up to `1e-12` require
investigation rather than automatic acceptance; published numeric precision must
match exactly. Configuration comparison checks every original scientific key
and uses an explicit metadata whitelist, never a whole-YAML exclusion.

Reproducible commands and comparator details are in the
[benchmark harness documentation](../scripts/benchmark/README.md). Prepared-cache
identity and current conservative downstream invalidation are documented in
[workflow optimization](workflow-optimization.md).

## Completed: full-reference summary preparation

Job `19190017` compared the original reference scans with the reusable reference
summary in three independent pairs on the full hg38 reference.

| Pair | Baseline actual CPU (s) | Candidate actual CPU (s) | Scientific comparison |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 172.23 | 80.62 | Identical |
| 2 | 175.55 | 80.58 | Identical |
| 3 | 185.78 | 86.81 | Identical |

Reported peak RSS was **16.045 GiB baseline** and **3.190 GiB candidate**.
Every pair matched the complete N-interval GRanges and collapsed 64-element
trinucleotide count vector using R `identical()`. These measurements cover
reference preparation only. Wall time and allocated CPU-hours are not transcribed
in this ledger; retain the raw measurement/accounting records for those metrics.

## Completed: one real LIB1 extraction chunk

The original and candidate extraction scripts were replayed once each on LIB1
chunk 1 with the same configuration and a two-CPU allocation. Complete scientific
QS contents matched exactly; only the explicit `/run_metadata` whitelist applied.

| Metric | Baseline | Candidate |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Actual CPU (s) | 971.42 | 702.81 |
| Wall time (s) | 985.35 | 733.63 |
| Allocated CPU-hours during measured command | 0.54741 | 0.40757 |
| Peak RSS (KiB) | 12,205,592 | 9,047,372 |

This single real-chunk comparison used **27.65% less actual CPU** and **25.88%
less peak RSS**. It is not a repeated benchmark or a whole-pipeline result.
Measurements are in workspace `runs/chunk-replay/extract.json` and
`runs/extract-candidate/extract.json`; the exact scientific comparison report is
`runs/extract-candidate/comparison.tsv`. Allocated CPU-hours above cover the timed
command, not its containing job's setup or validation overhead.

## Completed: existing final LIB1 QS2 profile

Job `19188581` profiled one existing final QS2. Its compressed size was **2.397
GiB** and its logical R object size was **31.751 GiB**. Principal logical components
were coverage (**20.049 GiB**), raw germline data (**9.456 GiB**), and formatted
germline data (**1.798 GiB**). Logical `object.size()` values can double-count
shared storage and are distinct from compressed size and process RSS.

| Phase | Actual CPU (s) | Wall time (s) | Peak RSS (GiB) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Load | 137.56 | 138.81 | 31.8 |
| Save | 86.00 | 87.08 | approximately 32.2 |

Saving this loaded object did not reproduce the much larger historical
`outputResults` task peak. The measured final object does not explain that entire
task's memory use; assembly and export temporaries remain profiling targets.
The selected design retains **one final QS2 per sample**, along with existing
TSV, VCF, PDF, BED.gz, and Tabix products. No call batching or output sharding is
introduced, and no scientific schema change is authorized by these measurements.

## Pending before overall conclusions

- Complete comparable baseline and candidate runs for both samples; compare
  total actual CPU, wall time, allocated CPU-hours, and high-memory-stage RSS.
- Compare complete nested scientific QS objects and every published scientific
  output, resolving all discrepancies and binary-file review findings.
- Complete paired measurements and exact-output checks for the remaining
  implementations. Combined filtering, BAM dispatch, BED annotation alternatives,
  and coordinate-sort reuse remain experiments until separately accepted.
- Validate cache/resume behavior, effective YAML parsing and scientific keys,
  including missing prepared artifacts and concurrent launches.

The baseline source revision is
`6b6598b236d1f4a96e9e34597f7c7fa3c2cb2a3a`. Candidate revisions must be recorded with
each subsequent measurement. This initial ledger transcribes the completed
reference and QS2 measurements from the workspace `WORK_LOG.md`; isolated runs
and accounting artifacts are retained under the workspace `runs/` directory.
